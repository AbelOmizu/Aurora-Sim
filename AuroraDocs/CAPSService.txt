About the CAPS Service:
	
The CAPS Service is an internal ROBUST service that is used to control what CAPS the region has access to control.
This service is used to provide grid-wide CAPS that are secure, even in an open-grid setting.
By using this service, you (the grid operator) can control what CAPS the regions can use.


HOW TO SET UP:

In Robust.ini (or Robust.HG.ini), you will need to set a few config settings. These include the:
[AuroraLoginService] 

* In this section, you will need to change: 
CAPSServicePassword    - This should be set to a random password that you will then use again later. This does NOT need to be given out.
CAPSServiceURL         - This is the path to your Robust server and port 8007. Ex. "http://<IP>:8007" where <IP> is your IP or dns hostname.

and the
[CAPSService] section

* In this section, you will need to change:
Password   - This should be set to the random password that used earlier in [AuroraLoginService].
HostName   - This is the path to your Robust server and port 8007. Ex. "http://<IP>:8007" where <IP> is your IP or dns hostname.

After setting these options, you will have set up the CAPS Service and will have the ability to override Simulator CAPS that the Simulator may try to set.
