    ;; This plugin loads the region information (such as terrain and objects) from an Aurora Backup file 
	;; rather than from a normal database. This is much faster than a normal database and can be used to
	;; automatically save backups of regions as well.
	;;
	
	;;
	;; To use this plugin, first load your regions in the normal database without having this plugin enabled
	;; Then, for each region, save an Aurora Backup with the default name 
	;;    1) use "change region <region name here>"
	;;    2) do "save archive" and follow the given steps (don't save assets!)
	;; After this is complete, enable this module and start up again, and it will use the .abackup files
	;; instead of the normal database
