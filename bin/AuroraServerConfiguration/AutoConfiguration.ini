[Configuration]

    ;;
    ;; All of the given settings are so that Aurora sims that are connecting can just input one URL instead of all of the following.
    ;; These settings will need to be set to your external IP or a DNS name instead of "127.0.0.1" (unless you wish to run with localhost set)
    ;;
    ;; If you wish to run more than one instance of Aurora.Server to load balance, add more urls by adding a , after each url you want to add
    HostNames = "127.0.0.1"
